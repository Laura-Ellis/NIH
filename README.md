# NIH Data Science Integration and Impact Analysis

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the integration, scope, and impact of data science in NIH-funded research. The analysis covers projects, publications, patents, and grants across various NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). The analysis plan includes descriptive analysis, time-series trends, impact assessments, and network analysis. The primary goal is to understand how data science is shaping biomedical research and contributing to translational outcomes across NIH.

## Steps
### 1. Download NIH RePORTER Data

### 2. Create Term Lists by Research Area
To identify relevant projects, generate keyword lists tailored to different areas within data science, such as:
    Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    Machine Learning
    Computational Biology
    Bioinformatics
    Big Data
These term lists will be used to filter the downloaded NIH RePORTER data to identify relevant projects.

### 3. Identify and Extract Projects
Using the generated term lists, perform a keyword-based filtering of NIH-funded projects, publications, and patents. This step will help categorize and identify data science-related projects. You can use a Python script to apply the filters across the datasets.

### 4. Analyze Results
This step involves performing analyses across NIH ICs and activity codes to assess the scope and impact of data science projects. The key analyses include:

#### A. Descriptive Analysis
IC and Activity Code Breakdown: Count the total number of data science-related projects, publications, and patents across NIH ICs and activity codes.
Keyword Prevalence: Calculate the proportion of data science projects across ICs and activity codes.
Funding Allocation: Identify how funding for data science projects is distributed across ICs and activity codes.
#### B. Time-Series Analysis
Track the evolution of data science research by analyzing projects, publications, and patents over the past 10-20 years.
Compare funding trends for data science projects by NIH IC and activity code to assess growth over time.
### 5. Expanded Impact Analysis
This stage focuses on evaluating the broader impact of data science research:

#### A. Publications Impact
Citation Analysis: Analyze the total citations for data science publications, broken down by NIH IC and activity code.
h-index: Compute the h-index of data science researchers and projects to assess research impact.
Journal Impact Factor (JIF): Evaluate the quality of journals where NIH-funded data science research is published.
#### B. Patent and Innovation Impact
Patent Filing and Citation Rates: Measure the number of patents filed from data science projects and analyze their citation metrics.
Commercialization: Track which patents have been licensed or commercialized, focusing on specific NIH activity codes.
#### C. Research Output and Knowledge Dissemination
Analyze cross-IC collaborations and evaluate how data science research is translated into clinical trials, protocols, or new technologies.
#### D. Longitudinal Impact Assessment
Track the cumulative research output of data science projects and identify emerging fields (e.g., AI in genomics) within NIH funding.
### 6. Network and Collaboration Analysis
This section analyzes the collaborative nature of data science research:
Co-authorship Networks: Build co-authorship networks to identify collaborations across ICs and activity codes.
Interdisciplinary Networks: Assess how data science is applied across various fields and its contribution to research outputs.
### 7. Data Visualization
The following visualizations are suggested to highlight key findings:

## IC and Activity Code Breakdown: 
Bar charts to show the distribution of data science projects across NIH ICs and activity codes.
Trends Over Time: Line charts depicting the evolution of data science projects, publications, and patents over time.
Collaboration Networks: Visualize co-authorship and cross-IC collaborations using network diagrams.
Impact Heatmaps: Create heatmaps to display citation and patent impact by IC and activity code.

## Conclusion
This analytical framework provides a robust method to assess the integration, scope, and impact of data science across NIH-funded research. By leveraging keyword-based filtering, funding trends, and impact metrics, this framework can help identify key contributors to NIH-funded data science research and its broader influence on innovation and healthcare advancements.
